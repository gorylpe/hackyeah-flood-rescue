# Flood Rescue 

Made for X-NATURE at [HackYeah](https://hackyeah.pl).

## Project description

Our goal was to model the task of flood control. 

We have implemented the role of a dispatch officer
coordinating the actions of firefighters in a small city.

The player can control firetrucks and helicopters which deploy barriers limiting and redirecting
water flow.

While our demo is very bare-bones, it does share multiple
characteristics with the real world problem:
- the elements are unforgiving and not fair: humans are at a serious disadvantage,
- trying to protect our resources is only a form of damage control and ends up as a net loss,
- even small mistakes on our part can lead to catastrophic results.
