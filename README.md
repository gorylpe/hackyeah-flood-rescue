# Flood Rescue

Made for X-NATURE at [HackYeah](https://hackyeah.pl).

## Project description

Our goal was to model the task of flood control.

We have implemented the role of a dispatch officer
coordinating the actions of firefighters in a small city.

The player can control firetrucks and helicopters which deploy barriers limiting and redirecting
water flow.

While our demo is very bare-bones, it does share multiple
characteristics with the real world problem:
- the elements are unforgiving and not fair: humans are at serious disadvantage,
- trying to protect our resources is only a form of damage control and ends up as a net loss,
- even no mistakes on our part can lead to catastrophic results.

The project was inspired by the [Great Flood of 1997](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Central_European_flood).
